## Introduction

The Pokémon Trading Figure Game is a two-player game played with collectible Pokémon Trading Figures made by Kaiyodo. It shares some characteristics with other collectible miniature games, such as Mage Knight and HeroClix. It also shares similarities with the Pokémon Trading Card Game [...]. It was released in Europe, Australia, and Southeast Asia in fall 2006, and North America and Japan in 2007.

Following the initial test phase in the European and Australian market, the TFG's American transition was plagued by delays. Coupled with the cost of the figures and an arguable lack of support within the Pokémon Organized Play program, the TFG was officially discontinued on June 2, 2009 following an announcement by Organized Play director Dave Schwimmer.

## Context

Back in 2013, my brother made a first C program to randomize the movements used by the game's miniatures and to also randomize teams.

Around 2015, I started using the HighGUI of OPENCV, a library I had used in our final-year project of the highschool integrated to technical school Fundação Liberato (Novo Hamburgo, Brazil), to make a first simple graphic interface. Of course, this was not one of the most appropriate tools for this project, but it allowed me to learn more about the library and start learning C++.

I had the opportunity in 2020 to attend the course Gui Programming in C++ (using Qt/QML) at the École Centrale de Lyon (Écully, France). And I decided to revisit and expand this project, now in Qt/QML.

For now, this consisted in creating some QML components for the creation of the playing field  [From Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokémon encyclopedia](https://www.pokebip.com/images/2007/286.jpg. "Pokémon Trading Figure Game 3 x3 field"))


In the future, the goal would be to allow the creation of custom fields (reusing these components), as well as using the Qt network communication capabilities to allow remote matches.

And, of course, learn many things in this journey!
